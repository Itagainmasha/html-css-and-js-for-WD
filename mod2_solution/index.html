                    The capybara or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America.
                     It is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the 
                     lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is 
                     more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria.

                <p>
                    The aye-aye is a long-fingered lemur, a strepsirrhine primate native to Madagascar with rodent-like teeth that 
                    perpetually grow and a special thin middle finger. It is characterized 
                    by its unusual method of finding food: it taps on trees to find grubs, then gnaws holes in the wood using its 
                    forward-slanting incisors to create a small hole into which it inserts its narrow middle finger to pull the grubs out.

                    Maratus jactatus (sparklemuffin) is a species of the genus Maratus, an 
                    Australian member of the jumping spider family. Maratus jactatus are from the jumping spider group Salticidae.
                    The name jactatus is Latin for rocking - derived from their signature mating rituals. Maratus jactatus have the 
                    ability to jump lengths up to 50 times their size. They have been collected only in Wondul Range National.
